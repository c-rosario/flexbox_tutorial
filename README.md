# flexbox_tutorial
A simple tutorial that teaches the basics of flexbox.
The tutorial can be found here: https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/

What I've learned:
    -There are flex containers and flex items
    -Flex items are the contents of flex containers
    -To make an HTML element a flex container, add display: flex;
    -Vertical alignment is defined by adding an align-items property to a flex container.
    -To create a grid, use the flex-wrap property.
    -“Direction” refers to whether a container renders its items horizontally or vertically.
      Use flex-direction to change direction col/row.
      -this property is especially useful when building responsive layouts for mobile users
    -Adding an order property to a flex item defines its order in the container without affecting 
     surrounding items
